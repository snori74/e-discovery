# old e-discovery scripts
_Bash scripts for an e-discovery job. Searches emails, including PDF attachments, OCR etc for specific phrases_

Mainly of interest because:
* some odd tricks to handle filenames and paths with spaces in them
* pulling apart of Microsoft .PST files
* extraction of text from PDFs and other files
* ose of OCR to get text from "scanned to PDF" files

Probably the most bash I'll ever write!
